# **Task Management System**

## **Overview**
The Task Management System is a software solution designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. It allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks, track deadlines, and manage task statuses. The project is developed as part of the **SW 301: Object-Oriented Analysis and Design** course at Zewail City for Science and technology.

This project demonstrates the application of OOAD principles, UML modeling, and system design techniques. Data persistence is implemented using **local storage**, ensuring users' data is retained between sessions on the same browser.
