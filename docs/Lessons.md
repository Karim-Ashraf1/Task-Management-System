#### Faris

Working on the majority of the code implementation provided valuable insight into structuring complex systems efficiently. Debugging and performance optimization taught me the importance of foresight in initial design. Additionally, creating the interaction and use case diagrams allowed me to visualize and document system behaviors effectively, improving my ability to communicate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.

#### Taha

Drafting the vision and business rules honed my ability to think strategically about the projectâ€™s purpose and align it with user needs. Developing sequence and state machine diagrams reinforced my understanding of user-centric design principles and highlighted the importance of planning for seamless system interactions. This experience enhanced my analytical and diagramming skills, especially for UI-related processes.

#### Karim

Focusing on documentation and UI design deepened my appreciation for the non-coding aspects of software development. The glossary and supplementary specifications emphasized the value of clarity in communication, while working on the logical architecture and GUI snapshots sharpened my ability to design systems that are both functional and user-friendly. This role improved my attention to detail and cross-team coordination.

#### Team Reflections

Our collaboration underscored the importance of leveraging individual strengths and maintaining open communication. Weekly meetings allowed us to address challenges, provide feedback, and ensure alignment. By dividing responsibilities effectively, we maximized productivity and learned to appreciate the interconnectedness of technical, design, and documentation tasks. The project reinforced that success lies in a combination of technical expertise, strategic planning, and strong teamwork.
