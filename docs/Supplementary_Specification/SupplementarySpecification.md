# Supplementary Specification Document for Task Management System

## Introduction
The Task Management System is designed to help individuals and teams manage their tasks efficiently. This document focuses on the non-functional requirements and supplementary specifications for the system. It covers aspects such as logging, error handling, security, usability, performance, and other system-wide properties.

---

## Common Functionality

- **Logging and Error Handling**: Handle errors in a safe way to avoid system crashing.
- **Pluggable Business Rules**: Tasks can be assigned to multiple team members for collaboration.
- **Security**: All usage requires user authentication.

---

## Usability

- The user interface will be intuitive and straightforward, with clear navigation and well-labeled buttons.
- Task statuses will be color-coded for quick identification.
- The application will be accessible to users with disabilities, adhering to **WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)**.
- Text should be easily visible from 1 meter.

---

## Reliability

- In case of system failure, automated recovery processes will restart the application.
- Automated tests will be used to verify system reliability before deployment.
- Database queries will be optimized to handle large datasets efficiently.

---

## Implementation Constraints

- The application will be built using **Spring Boot (Java)** for the backend.
- The database will use **JPA** for development.
- The front-end will use **Thymeleaf**.

---

## Free Open Source Components

- **Spring Boot** for application development.
- **Hibernate** for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
- **JPA Database** for lightweight development and testing.
- **Maven** for dependency management.

---

## Interfaces

### Software Interfaces

- **REST APIs**: The system will expose RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations on tasks.
    - Example: `GET /tasks`, `POST /tasks`, `PUT /tasks/{id}`, `DELETE /tasks/{id}`.
- **Database Interface**: Hibernate will handle communication with the underlying database.
- **External Notifications**: The system may integrate with third-party notification services.

### User Interfaces

- A web-based interface for users to interact with the system.
- Responsive design to ensure usability on mobile devices.

---

## Application-Specific Domain Rules

- Tasks must have unique identifiers to avoid duplication.
- Deadlines should not be assigned in the past.

---

## Pricing

- The system will support free and premium tiers.
- **Premium users** can access additional features like team analytics and advanced filtering.

---

## Operating Systems

- Compatible with **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux**.
- Mobile access via **Android** and **iOS browsers**.

---

## Design Constraints

- Ensure the system is scalable for future enhancements.

---

## Internationalization

- Support for multiple languages, starting with **English** and **Spanish**.
- Allow for dynamic switching of languages by users.
